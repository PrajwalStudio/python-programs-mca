# Second Semester Python Programs (MCA)

This repository contains all the Python programs implemented as part of the **Second Semester** practical lab for the MCA curriculum. It covers foundational to intermediate concepts including **Recursion, OOP, File Handling, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**, and machine learning models like **Linear and Logistic Regression**.


## Folder Structure

- `Part-A/` → Core Python programs (Recursion, Search, OOP, etc.)
- `Part-B/` → Advanced programs using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and ML


## PART-A: Core Python Programs

| No. | Program Description |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1   | Factorial using Recursion |
| 2   | Linear Search |
| 3   | Insert Element into Sorted List |
| 4   | OOP: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Overriding |
| 5   | Palindrome Checker |
| 6   | Copy File Contents |


## PART-B: Data Science and ML Programs

| No. | Program Description |
|-----|----------------------|
| 1   | Create m×n Integer Array and Display Attributes |
| 2a  | NumPy: Array Manipulation, Search, Sort, Split |
| 2b  | NumPy: Broadcasting & Plotting |
| 3   | Pandas: Importing, Cleaning, Manipulating Datasets |
| 4   | Data Visualization with Matplotlib |
| 5   | Linear Regression using scikit-learn |
| 6   | Logistic Regression using scikit-learn |
| 7   | Time Series Analysis using Pandas |
| 8   | Seaborn Data Visualizations |


## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrajwalStudio/python-programs-mca.git
   cd python-programs-mca 


2. **Install required libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run individual files**
   Each `.py` file is standalone and can be executed from the terminal or your IDE.


## Requirements

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

* Python 3.10+
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

To install them all at once:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
